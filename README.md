# Introduction

**Model Framework:**

<img src="img/CRESTHH.png">

The CRESTH/H model framework integrates hydrologic model (CREST) and hydrodynamic model (anuga) to target heavy rainfall-induced flash flood.

Taking advantage of two models, CRESTHH is capable of simulating hydrologic streamflows, flood extend, flood depth, pushing the territory of traditional 1D streamflow simulation to 2D (extent) and 3D (depth).

## Powerful features

1. __Flash flood inundation__

2. __Hydrologic simulation__

3. __Coastal flooding (Tsunami, wave dynamics)
Impact of hydraulic structures (e.g., dam breaks)__

4. __A set of uncertainty/sensitivity analysis__

5. __Easy to use (can setup in Jupyter notebook)__

6. __Parallel computing__

7. __Efficiency (bottlenecks in C)__
